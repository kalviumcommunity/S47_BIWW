# S47_BIWW
This is my readme file


I didn't think much about it as it has to be as silly as possible.

so, the project's name is gonna be BIWW which stands for Best Interactions With Wardens.

It's going to be a list where you can note down your "best" interactions with your hostel wardens. Feel free to share as much as you feel like. And just to clear things out, the wardens aren't going to read it.
